### Project Description
"The Life of Chapathi" is a hilariously useless website that follows a chapathi‚Äôs journey from birth to death. From generating horoscopes based on its shape to swiping on fellow chapathis and writing dramatic obituaries, it's the emotional rollercoaster no flatbread asked for.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world where everything ‚Äî from dogs to plants ‚Äî gets personalized apps, chapathis remain uncelebrated and emotionally neglected. There's no platform to honor their journey from dough to doom. We identified this gaping hole in society and decided to solve a problem nobody asked for:
"How can we document and dignify the life cycle of a chapathi?"

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created "The Life of Chapathi", a satirical web platform that gives chapathis the emotional spotlight they never needed. By combining AI-driven horoscope predictions, Tinder-style matchmaking, sarcastic commentary, and customizable death scenarios, our website allows users to experience and mourn the complete lifecycle of a chapathi ‚Äî all in one useless, delightful place.

This screenshot displays the *TinderRoti* section ‚Äî a playful dating app for chapathis.

True love never tasted this round.
